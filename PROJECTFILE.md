Project Overview
This project is a simple Hotel Room Management System implemented in Python, allowing users to initialize rooms for a hotel, set room prices, dynamically add or remove rooms, and manage basic details about room status and customers. The system uses a combination of dictionaries, lists, and NumPy arrays for efficient data handling.

Key Features
Room Numbering & Initialization: Rooms are organized by floors and numbers (e.g., 101, 102 for floor 1).

Dynamic Modification: Users can add or remove rooms interactively.

Customer & Rental Information: Each room holds a dictionary to store customer details, occupancy status, billing, and other relevant data.

Simple User Interface: Console-based prompts guide the user through initializing and updating the room list.

This project provides a foundation for a simple hotel management application. The modular structure makes it easy to extend for real-world use, with further improvements possible in error handling, persistent storage, and user interface design.
